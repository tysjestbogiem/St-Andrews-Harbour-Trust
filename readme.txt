>>>>> House Rules for GitHub - WordPress <<<<<

What we should and shoudn't push to GitHub:

Push 
  << Theme code (like style.css, functions.php)
  << Custom templates (template-home.php, etc.)
  << JS, CSS, and files you write
  << Plugins we build, if any

Don't Push
  >> Pages or posts we create in the WP dashboard
  >> Images & uploads (they live in /uploads)
  >> wp-config.php (safety first!)
  >> Plugin folders we didn’t create

>>>>> Rule of thumb: <<<<<
If you coded it, push it.
If you created it using the WP dashboard, don’t.
